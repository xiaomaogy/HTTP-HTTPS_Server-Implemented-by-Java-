# HTTP-HTTPS_Server-Implemented-by-Java-

Description:

This is a web server that can respond to both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

I didn't use the Java's own library to handle the HTTP request, but coded my own method and answers the HTTP response based on the HTTP request I am given.

You can use command: java Server --serverPort 4444 --sslServerPort 5555     to assign a 4444 port number for the HTTP server and a 5555 port number for the HTTPS server.
